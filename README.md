# My Work
##
## Product @ Avoy
Currently a product manager at Avoy, a travel-startup building out an ecosystem of applications and products for travellers and businesses around the world to find the best hidden gems and unbeaten destinations based on consumer preferences.
I'm currently a product lead for [Avoy Marketing](https://partners.avoy.io):

At Certik, I was part of several product teams; most notably the [CertiKShield](https://shield.certik.foundation/):

and [Auditing Portal](https://certik.io/):

I helped conceptualize, design and release the CertiKShield platform, working alongside various stakeholders including engineers, designers and the COO. Work ranged from widely from brainstorming feature ideas, testing APIs, and illustrating wireframes to producing a actionable prototype for the engineering team. CertiKShield is designed to help decentralize converage for staking pool users who want to be covered for any potential loss in wallet crypto or their stake. Users can join pools and earn crypto from staking regularly while being simultaneously covered by paying a small monthly fee.

Along with CertiKShield, I helped conceptualize and prepare the prelaunch of CertiK's auditing portal, which is designed to help streamline client auditing projects with an interactive user-facing platform for easier communication and GitHub comment viewing.

I also supported the Marketing Team's efforts in launching their new marketing campaign throughout the summer, with the goal of acquiring new blockchain ambassadors, establishing partnership programs and streamlining marketing analytics for easier KPI analysis.

## Product Manager Intern @ SAP
SAP provided my my first product management internship! I worked primarily with senior product managers on the SAP HANA in-memory database, specifically the admin console, the [SAP HANA Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_HANA_COCKPIT/2.12.0.0/en-US):

I eventually also worked on [SAP HANA Cloud](https://www.sap.com/canada/products/hana/cloud.html). I helped the HANA Cloud team with performing market analysis and competitive intelligence on other cloud platform service providers. Conducting environmental analyses with various tools and frameworks, I crafted a roadmap strategy for the HANA Cloud admin console, the platform allowing users to configure access control, security, IAM, and cloud deployment settings.
