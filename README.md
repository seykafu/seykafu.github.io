* CertiKShield is designed to help decentralize converage for staking pool users who want to be covered for any potential loss in wallet crypto or their stake. Users can join pools and earn crypto from staking regularly while being simultaneously covered by paying a small monthly fee.

* I helped conceptualize, design and release the CertiKShield platform.
    * I worked alongside engineers, designers and the COO to research and validate feature viabilty and feasibility

    * Work ranged from brainstorming feature ideas, testing APIs, and illustrating wireframes to producing a actionable prototype for the engineering team.
    

* I also helped conceptualize and prepare the prelaunch of CertiK's auditing portal, designed to help support CertiK's auditing services in a more programmatic way.

* Along with my product-related projects, I supported the Marketing Team's efforts in launching their new chain marketing campaign, with the goal of acquiring new blockchain ambassadors, establishing partnership programs and streamlining marketing analytics for easier KPI analysis.

Specifically, I helped improve features for data versatility, data governance, and internal admin management:

## Product Manager Intern @ SAP
SAP provided my my first product management internship! I worked primarily with senior product managers on the SAP HANA in-memory database, specifically the admin console, the [SAP HANA Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_HANA_COCKPIT/2.12.0.0/en-US):

I eventually also worked on [SAP HANA Cloud](https://www.sap.com/canada/products/hana/cloud.html). I helped the HANA Cloud team with performing market analysis and competitive intelligence on other cloud platform service providers. Conducting environmental analyses with various tools and frameworks, I crafted a roadmap strategy for the HANA Cloud admin console, the platform allowing users to configure access control, security, IAM, and cloud deployment settings.

## Consulting and Analytics Intern @ Precima

At Precima, I primarily worked on a data snapshot comparison and subsequent Excel analysis project for clients in the retail and commerce space.

Here are some of my achievements in-depth:
1. Optimized client revenue potential by 10% by first defining data and project requirements and communicating with client-facing team.

2. Next, I commensed the data standardization project in SQL and Shell Scripts by running 50+ SQL queries to build the proper tables necessary on AWS RedShift, with the key focus on determining significant differences in 6-month snapshots.

3. Finally, the end deliverable comprised of generated data insights from the un-wrangled client data via QlikView, Excel Tables and other visualizations.
